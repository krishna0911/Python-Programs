In this problem we want to find the root of a function, such as  𝑔(𝑥)=𝑥3−4𝑥+1 in the interval  [1,2], by writing a function my_root(h,left,right) that takes in a function  ℎ, and an interval [left,right] that contains the root you're trying to find. The output should be the number of guesses required to find the approximate root, as well as the root.
For example, when we run my_root(g,1,2) our output should be
Number of Guesses is  5
1.859375  is close to the root of the given function.

SOLUTION:

def g(x):
    return x**3-4*x+1
def my_root(h,left,right):
    epsilon=.01
    numGuesses=0
    lim1 = left
    lim2 = right
    numGuesses = 0
    ans= (lim1+lim2)/2.0
    while abs(g(ans) - 0) >epsilon:
        numGuesses += 1
        if g(ans) < 0:
            lim1 = ans
        else:
            lim2 = ans
        ans = (lim1+lim2)/2.0
    print("Number of Guesses is ",numGuesses)
    print(ans," is close to the root of the given function")
