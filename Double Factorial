Write a program that calculates  𝑛!! recursively. As a reminder, this is defined iteratively as
𝑛!!=𝑛∗(𝑛−2)∗(𝑛−4)∗...Make sure your program handles even and odd cases.

SOLUTION:
def nDoubleFactorial(n):
    fact=1
    if n==1 or n==0:
        return 1
    else:
        return (n*nDoubleFactorial(n-2))
    #raise NotImplementedError()
