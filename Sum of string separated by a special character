Write a program ffd(s) that takes in a string s of decimal numbers, separated by commas, e.g. s='1.5,6.4,3.8', and returns the sum of the decimal numbers. In our example, ffd(s) should return 11.7.
You may want to use the fact that s[i,j] returns the portion of the string starting at the character in position  𝑖 and ending at the character in position  𝑗−1. Recursion might also help you in your solution, but all that matters is that the tests below are satisfied.


SOLUTION:
def ffd(s):
    k=s.split(',')
    l=len(k)
    sum=0
    for i in range (0,l):
            k[i]=float(k[i])
            sum=sum+k[i]
    return sum
